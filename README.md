## SkyChat quick tour

The **SkyChat** is a modern-looking discussion platform with real-time visualisation of everyone's cursor, and a shared and synchronized youtube player.

It also includes many customisation/entertainment features such as:
- Custom text and halo colors to be bought for user messages
- Virtual money with mini-games (casino roulette, guess the number)
- An XP system with associated ranks, based on users activity
- Custom profile pictures (guests have randomly generated ones)

Most of these features can be enabled-disabled from the configuration file.

Overall, here is what it looks like:

### Synchronized Youtube Player

Users can play any youtube video on a shared and synchronized player. Orchestration is implemented through a public queue of videos to play, and decision-making (for instance to skip videos) is done with polls. Democracy ðŸ’¯

### Live cursor visualization and mini-games

Users can interact and play with integrated mini-games (which can be disabled in the configuration).
Seeing each other cursors give a sense of proximity between users. Seeing mouse movements is the most iconic features of the SkyChat.

### Cinema mode

If watching long videos, documentaries, or tv shows, the cinema-mode allows users to watch the video in full-screen and have the tchat minimized on the bottom-right of the screen.

### And much more

This is not all, but to discover all features, you may as well launch an instance yourself and try it yourself

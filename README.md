# SkyChat

The **SkyChat** is a modern-looking discussion platform with real-time visualisation of everyone's cursor, and a shared and synchronized youtube player.

It also includes many customisation/entertainment features such as:
- Custom text and halo colors to be bought for user messages
- Virtual money with mini-games (casino roulette, guess the number)
- An XP system with associated ranks, based on users activity
- Custom profile pictures (guests have randomly generated ones)

Most of these features can be enabled-disabled from the configuration file.

Overall, here is what it looks like:

### Synchronized Youtube Player

Users can play any youtube video on a shared and synchronized player. Orchestration is implemented through a public queue of videos to play, and decision-making (for instance to skip videos) is done with polls. Democracy ðŸ’¯

### Live cursor visualization and mini-games

Users can interact and play with integrated mini-games (which can be disabled in the configuration).
Users can also see each other cursors moving in real time. This gives a sense of proximity between users. This is the most iconic feature of the SkyChat.

### Cinema mode

If watching long videos, documentaries, or tv shows, the cinema-mode allows users to watch the video in full-screen and have the tchat minimized on the bottom-right of the screen.

### And much more

This is not all, but to discover all features, you may as well launch an instance and try it yourself!

## How to install

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- sqlite3
- nodejs/npm

Then, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skychatorg/skychat.git
cd skychat

# 2. Install nodejs dependencies
npm i

# 3. Generates the .env.json, stickers.json, config.json files and the database
npm run setup

# 4. Build and run the app
npm run dev
```

### Setup Youtube

The SkyChat requires a key for the Youtube plugin to work. This key needs to be put in your `.env.json` file.

Using the Youtube API is free but there is a daily quota, which when exceeded blocks the requests until the next day. If it happens, the Youtube plugin will be disabled until the next day. 

1. Go to [the Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/credentials). If you never activated the account, you will have to activate it. 
2. Click `Create credentials > API key`
3. Copy the generated API key, and paste it in your `.env.json` file (the variable name is `youtube_api_key`)
4. Restart the server


### Setup a super-user

In order to escalate user rights, you can setup a super-user by editing the `.env.json` file and adding one or multiple usernames in the `op` array.

## How to dev

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a static file server & websocket server on http://localhost:8080
When the source files change, the build processes runs automatically

## The env.json file

The fields in the .env.json contain private information related to the application.

The semantic of these fields are defined below:

**ranks**

- Type: `Array<{limit: number, images: {'18': string, '26': string}}>`
- Description: Rank definition (xp threshold and image path). Must be sorted by descending limit.
  - limit: XP limit to have this rank. The last rank definition must have `0` as the limit, otherwise new users will not have any rank.
  - images: Image path corresponding to the rank icon for each 18 and 26px sizes. Image paths should be relative to `/assets/images/`.


**plugins**

- Description: Enabled plugins. Must only define classes exported by `app/server/skychat/commands/impl/index.ts`
